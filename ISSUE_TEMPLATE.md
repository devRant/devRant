# Creating an issue
Before creating an issue, make sure you have read our contributing rules here:
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Skayo/devRant/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Afterwards, please use one of the templates (click on the link):
[Bug Report](?template=bug.md)
[Feature Request](?template=feature.md)
[Question](?template=question.md)

If you have a third-party client that doesn't support multiple issue templates, just copy the content of the file in the ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ directory.
