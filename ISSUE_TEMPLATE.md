# Creating an issue
Before creating an issue, make sure you have read our contributing rules here:  
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/devRant/devRant/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Afterwards, please use one of the templates (click on the link):
- [Bug Report](https://github.com/devRant/devRant/issues/new?template=bug.md)
- [Feature Request](https://github.com/devRant/devRant/issues/new?template=feature.md)
- [Question](https://github.com/devRant/devRant/issues/new?template=question.md)
- [Community-created projects page request](https://github.com/devRant/devRant/issues/new?template=projectspage.md)

If you have a third-party client that doesn't support multiple issue templates, just copy the content of the file in the ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ directory.
