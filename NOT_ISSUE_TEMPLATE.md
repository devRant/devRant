# Creating an issue
Please use one of the templates:

[Bug Report](https://github.com/devRant/devRant/issues/new?template=bug.md)
[Feature Request](https://github.com/devRant/devRant/issues/new?template=feature.md)
[Question](https://github.com/devRant/devRant/issues/new?template=question.md)

If you have a third-party client that doesn't support multiple issue templates, just copy the content in the ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ directory.
